AdvancedSubclassing is a subclass manager for SCP: SL. It allows you to make and manage subclasses with no coding knowledge.

I am always looking for ability suggestions, message me on discord, or make a new [issue](https://github.com/steven4547466/AdvancedSubclassing/issues/new)!

The latest stable release can be found [here](https://github.com/steven4547466/AdvancedSubclassing/releases/latest). This plugin requires EXILED to run, you can find more [here](https://github.com/galaxy119/EXILED).
